                                <p>The FOCUS League is a competitive Ultimate league in Houston intended for players with intermediate to advanced skills in the sport of Ultimate. The mission of this league is to structure would-be pick-up games into a series of 4 week cycles and increase the availability of competitive Ultimate in Houston. Registered players will be divided into X number of teams and remain together for a 4 week cycle. Each team will have a team captain(s) who will lead the team in developing the team offense and defense (i.e., teams will call offensive plays, call defenses with a marking direction, work on zones, crumbles, and any other strategic points of interest of the team).</p>

                                <p>You are still able to sign up and give the FOCUS League a try. However, keep in mind that the FOCUS League is intended for the experienced player. If you do not understand terms/concepts like force, flick, backhand, hammer, scoober, huck, cut, vertical stack offense, horizontal offense, man defense, zone defense, zone crumble, zone cup, foul, pick, poach, etc, as they relate to Ultimate then you may not find the FOCUS League an enjoyable experience. If you cannot throw a 15 yard leading flick and backhand with accuracy to a receiver, then you may not find the FOCUS League an enjoyable experience.</p>

                                <p>If you are still unsure if this league is for you, feel free to get in touch with us to discuss it.</p>

                                <p>Note: While the league organizers do not want to exclude anyone, if a large disparity in level of play develops, the league organizers may request less skilled players to excuse themselves. In the unlikely event this occurs it will include a refund of the remaining game fees.</p>

                                    <p>Ultimate, originally known as ultimate frisbee, is a non-contact team field sport played with a flying disc. Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc, and interceptions, incomplete passes, and passes out of bounds are turnovers. Rain, wind, or occasionally other adversities can make for a testing match with rapid turnovers, heightening the pressure of play.</p>
