    <p>FOCUS Leaguers,</p>

    <p><strong>Games are ON for Tuesday, June 28!</strong> We are on the turf field, HSP scouts state its not raining any more. Radar is looking favorable.</p>

    <p>We sent out an email earlier to guage interest but some people stated they did not receive it. Of the people who did receive it, ~14 said yes. So we know we have enough for a game. We will adjust the game format creatively based on how many people show up. If you weren't signed up to play tonight, feel free to come out, We're sure there will be a spot for you.</p>

    <p>--<br>Asif and Nicky</p>
