    <p>FOCUS Leaguers,</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, games are canceled for Tuesday, Apr 26 since HSP grass fields are closed due to excessive rain in the last week.</p>

    <p>If you are signed up to play tonight, then you will be receiving a $5 credit in your FOCUS League account to be used towards your next payment. If you were signed up to play last week, you will be getting $5 credit for that week as well. This is in spite of HSP not offering refunds for field rentals. Please pay your outstanding balance if you have one.</p>

    <p>Registration for Cycle 2016-03 will open tomorrow. Cycle 2016-03 will be a 3 week cycle; May 3, May 10, and May 17.</p>

    <p>Hope to see y'all next week if the weather plays nice!</p>

    <p>--<br>Asif Mohammed</p>
