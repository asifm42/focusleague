    <p>FOCUS Leaguers,</p>

    <h3>Aargh!</h3>

    <p>Unfortunately, games are canceled for Thursday, Feb 28th since HSP grass fields are closed due to excessive rain in the past couple days.</p>

    <p>We are going to be reducing Cycle 2019-01 to 2 weeks from 3 weeks. We will reopen sign-up tomorrow and keep it open until Thursday, Mar 7th, 3pm. We will announce teams by 6pm that day.
    </p>

    <p>If you were signed up for 2 weeks and one of them was this week then we'll change your remaining week to a sub sign-up. Otherwise, we'll just take this week off if you were signed up for 3 weeks. Fees will be adjusted accordingly.</p>

    <p>Feel free to reply back if you have any questions.</p>

    <p>Hope to see y'all next week if the weather plays nice!</p>

    <p>- The FOCUS League Team (Asif &amp; Nicky)</p>
